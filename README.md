# Basic Digital Design
Repository to track my own codes/progress/learning on the [EAMTA 2021 Digital Design](https://www.sites.google.com/view/congresoargentinoelectronica/eamta-2021/digital-design) course.

In this course we review and learn the basics of FPGA programming using Verilog.
We test the codes and program a Xilinx Arty 07-35.

To synth the code, run linters and urilize different IP cores, I use vivado which comes
with the Xilinx Core Development Kit 2019.2 [LINK](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis/2019-2.html).

This tool also enables us to run IP cores to remote control and register FPGA's I/O.
